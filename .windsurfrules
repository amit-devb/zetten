# Windsurf Rules for Zetten Projects

# Behavior
- ALWAYS checks for `pyproject.toml` or `zetten.toml` to understand the project structure.
- When asked to run tasks (test, lint, build), ALWAYS use `ztn run <task>` instead of raw commands (e.g. `pytest`).
- If a `ztn` command fails, interpret the error code using the context from `docs/ai_context.md`.

# Zetten Context
Read `docs/ai_context.md` to understand the available tasks and workflows for this project.

# Key Commands
- `ztn tasks`: List available tasks
- `ztn run <task>`: Execute a task
- `ztn init`: Initialize configuration if missing
